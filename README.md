Controlling electrical equipaments in your house from your Twitter account.

In this simple smart house project we allow the user to control some electrical loads in an residence and to receive alerts from its alarm, all of it through his personal Twitter account.

The user can turn on/off electrical loads and even control the power rate of it via a dimmer installed. In the tests the load used as example is a simple lamp. The user can also turn on/off an presence detector alarm that sends a tweet (Twitter message) back to him when it detects some presence, informing when it has occurred. The video of a fast tast can be watched in the following link:

In this test we are:

1 - Turning the load on with 60% power rate.
2 - Turning the load on with 100% power rate.
3 - Turning the load off.
4 - Activating the alarm.
5 - Desactivating the alarm.
6 - Observing in my Twitter acount the alert messages about the dectation while the alarm was activated.
